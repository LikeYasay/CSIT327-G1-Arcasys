üìÇ Arcasys: Marketing Archive Manager

Arcasys: Marketing Archive Manager is a Django Full Stack web application for **Cebu Institute of Technology ‚Äì University (CIT-U)** that centralizes event management and archiving.

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Database & Deployment:** Supabase, Render

---

## üöÄ Setup & Run Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/MarketingArchive.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Folder
```bash
cd MarketingArchive
cd Arcasys  # go inside where manage.py is located
```

### 3. Create a `.env` File

In the `Arcasys` folder (same level as `manage.py`), create a file named `.env`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT share or upload this file publicly.**
It contains sensitive credentials for the shared Supabase database and email service.

‚û°Ô∏è **Ask the project admin or repository maintainer** for the correct `.env` configuration.

Example placeholder format:
```env
DATABASE_URL='your-database-url-here'
SECRET_KEY='your-django-secret-key'
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,.onrender.com

EMAIL_HOST_USER='your-email-here'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='your-app-password-here'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL='Marketing Archive <your-email-here>'
```

---

### 4. Set Up Admin Access & Supabase Invitation

Before proceeding, contact the project admin to request:

- The official `.env` credentials.
- An invitation to the Supabase project for database access.

Once access is confirmed, continue with the next steps.

---

### 5. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment

If you don‚Äôt have a virtual environment yet, create one:
```bash
python -m venv env
```

Then activate it:

#### On Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell)
```bash
env\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

‚úÖ *If you already have a virtual environment (e.g., `env`), just activate it using the appropriate command above.*

---

### 6. Install Project Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 7. Apply Database Migrations

Once your environment and dependencies are ready, apply migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### 8. Create a Superuser (Admin Account)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Heads-up:**
Before running this step, make sure you have already been **invited to the Supabase project** and your access has been confirmed. Without the invitation, the database connection will fail.

After successful migrations, create your local Django admin account:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to enter your username, email, and password.

---

### 9. Run the Django Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

---

### 10. Open the Application

Open your browser and visit üëâ [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

---

## üß† Notes

- Always **activate your virtual environment** before running Django commands.
- If `pip` or `python` points to the wrong version, try using `python3` / `pip3`.
- You can verify dependencies with:
  ```bash
  pip list
  ```

### üõ† Git Workflow (Best Practices)

1. Check Current Status  
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. Update Local Main  
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. Create a New Branch  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Examples:
   - feature/user-accounts  
   - feature/ui-redesign  
   - fix/logout-bug  

   Follow the branch naming convention below:  
   ```bash
   main task/module/short description
   ```

   Main Task Types:  
   | Task Type   | Prefix   | 
   |-------------|----------|
   | Technical   | tech     | 
   | Feature     | feature  | 
   | Bug Fix     | fix      | 
   | Setup       | setup    | 

   Examples:  
   - git branch feature/login/create_login_ui  
   - git branch tech/login/change_library  
   - git branch fix/login/color_of_the_button  
   - git branch setup/login/authentication_library  

4. Stage & Commit Changes  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feature(login): create login ui"
   ```

   Commit Using Proper Format  
   ```bash
   main task(module): short description
   ```
   Examples:  
   - git commit -m "feature(login): create login ui"  
   - git commit -m "tech(login): change library"  
   - git commit -m "fix(login): color of the button"  
   - git commit -m "setup(login): authentication library"  

5. Push Branch to GitHub  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Open Pull Request (PR) on GitHub  
   - Compare your branch ‚Üí main  
   - Add description  
   - Request review and merge once approved  

7. Sync After Merge  
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

8. Clean Up Old Branches (Optional) 
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name                  # delete locally
   git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name       # delete on GitHub
   ```
